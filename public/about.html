<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am 27 year old dude living in Boulder Colorado. I grew up in San Diego, and went to college in LA. I studied Mechanical Engineering, and have always been drawn to taking things apart and learning how they work. I also love to get outside and ride my bikes. When I'm not riding or working, I am usually sitting on the couch chilling with my two cats. I have a wonderful girlfriend, Audrey, who I live with currently.

<p>I am currently intested in learning more about all things Software Engineering. I have a pretty strong backgroun in the Python language. I have written many Python programs, and have experience with tkinter, pandas, dataframes, and general computation. I am now learning more about websites, and wish to become proficient at HTML, CSS and Java. </p>

<p>In terms of my biking career, I own 3 bikes; gravel, mountain, and commuter. I ride the gravel bike mostly for fitness, and the mountain bike mostly for fun. I love the feeling of coming home from a long ride and being completely emptied of energy.</p>
